The primary heatmap features the correlation of each data query to the status, showing direct or inverse correlation from the data shown. 

Higher correlation statistics or a lighter color means that the patient is healthy if the data is a larger number. Inversely, lower correlation statistis or a darker color means that the patient is afflicted if the data is a smaller number. The latter two graphs show the correlation between individual queries only when the patient is healthy, which can be viewed in the first one, or afflicted, which can be viewed in the second one. 

General analysis can show that there is no strict correlation between a patient's status and any query. Therefore, it is difficult to state the status of a patient from only one column alone. However, there is a definitive correlation between queries like MDVP:Jitter(%) and NHR, where one is often a high number if the other one is a high number as well.
